# Howdy :wave:

I'm Alex.

I work on the Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) at GitHub. I function as the Tech Lead for our team, setting the technical direction of how we go about achieving success. 

Outside of work, I'm an avid fan of sustainability, adventure, philanthropy, computing, reading, and motorsport.
